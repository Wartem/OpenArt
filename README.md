# OpenArt
### Making open art data ready to use

**Currently Supported:**

- **National Gallery of Art:**  
  CSV files are automatically downloaded, extracted from open data ZIP files, and converted into a SQLite database file.

- **Metropolitan Museum of Art:**  
  Code is provided to add painting URLs from their website, complementing their open data. This data is included in the Open Art Viewer.

## Open Art Viewer
The SQLite file created by OpenArt can be directly used with the Open Art Viewer.  
You can download it here: [Open Art Viewer 1.0](https://wartem.net/files/OpenArtViewer%201.0.zip) (SQLite file is already included).

## Example Usage: GUI with Unity

Code Authorship Declaration
To the best of my knowledge, all or nearly all code in this project was written by me (Wartem), rather than generated by artificial intelligence or automated code generation tools. I utilized AI assistance to help identify and fix bugs in August 2024.

Moving forward, I plan to refactor this codebase with the aid of AI tools. However, this refactoring process will be conducted in a balanced manner, ensuring that the project's core structure and logic remain primarily my own work. The AI will be used as a tool to suggest improvements, optimize code, and help with best practices, but all final decisions and implementations will be made by me. This approach aims to enhance the project while maintaining my role as the primary author and architect of the codebase.
This declaration reflects my commitment to transparency about the use of AI in the development process, while also affirming my central role in the project's creation and evolution.
