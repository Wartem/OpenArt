# OpenArt
### Making open art data ready to use

**Currently Supported:**

- **National Gallery of Art:**  
  CSV files are automatically downloaded, extracted from open data ZIP files, and converted into a SQLite database file.

- **Metropolitan Museum of Art:**  
  Code is provided to add painting URLs from their website, complementing their open data. This data is included in the Open Art Viewer.

## Open Art Viewer
The SQLite file created by OpenArt can be directly used with the Open Art Viewer.  
You can download it here: [Open Art Viewer 1.0](https://wartem.net/files/OpenArtViewer%201.0.zip) (SQLite file is already included).

## Example Usage: GUI with Unity

## Code Authorship Declaration
To the best of my recollection, all or nearly all code in this project was written by me (Wartem) rather than 
artificial intelligence or automated code generation tools.
